# 🐾 Cats vs Dogs Image Classifier

This project is a simple yet effective Machine Learning model that classifies images as **cats** or **dogs** using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Built primarily for learning purposes, it demonstrates the full pipeline: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Image classification is one of the most common applications of computer vision. In this project, I aimed to build a model that can accurately distinguish between cats and dogs in photographs — a fun and practical challenge to deepen my understanding of neural networks.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to preprocess image datasets using TensorFlow and Keras  
- How to design and train a CNN architecture for binary classification  
- Evaluation techniques and visualization of model performance
